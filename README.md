CrawlEm
======

Making a web crawler in Ruby. 

Setting Up
--------

First you need to clone this project somewhere onto your computer. Using your terminal, navigate to the location you want to store the project then paste in the following:

```
git clone https://github.com/salexzee/CrawlEm.git
```

Next, you'll need the Mechanize gem so that the project can interact with websites.

```
gem install mechanize
```

Finally, you'll need a file called `urls.txt` to store the crawled URLs.

```
touch urls.txt
```
